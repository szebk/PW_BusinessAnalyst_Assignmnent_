# PW_BusinessAnalyst_Assignmnent_
This repository contains my solution to an assignment I was given during my internship as a Business Analyst at Physics Wallah. To secure the internship, I was given an assignment that consisted of eight analytical questions related to data analysis and business growth. Eight popular analysis questions related to multiple fields with different information for each data analysis and business growth made up this assignment. By using my MS Excel skills, I was able to complete the assignment by performing data cleaning, formatting, and statistical analysis on the provided Excel sheet. After completing the assignment, I shared my solution openly on GitHub, along with the Excel sheet used in the analysis, to contribute to the learning and development of others who might be interested in pursuing a career in business analysis. This repository can serve as a valuable resource for anyone who wants to develop their analytical skills, test their knowledge, and gain practical experience in data analysis using MS Excel.
